🚀 PROJECT CHARTER: SchoolBridge

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name:** SchoolBridge
**Tagline:** "Bridging Education Gaps, Online and Offline"
**Vision:** Create an accessible, offline-first school management platform that bridges educational gaps in underserved communities, starting with Madagascar.

## 2. Project Objectives
- ✅ Bridge communication between teachers, students, and parents
- ✅ Bridge online and offline learning experiences
- ✅ Bridge educational resources to remote areas
- ✅ Bridge skill gaps through personalized learning paths

Primary Goals:

- ✅ Provide comprehensive school management for teachers, students, parents, and admins
- ✅ Function reliably in low-connectivity environments
- ✅ Support both French and English languages
- ✅ Enable offline course access via mobile devices
- ✅ Facilitate course validation and teacher collaboration

Brand Identity:
- Primary Domain: schoolbridge.app
- Email: contact@schoolbridge.app
- Brand Colors: Bridge blue (#2563eb), Connection green (#10b981), Support orange (#f59e0b)
- Logo Concept: Bridge connecting communities (school-home, online-offline, teacher-student)


Success Metrics:
- 90% core functionality available offline
- Support 1,000+ concurrent users
- Course materials downloadable under 2MB each
- < 3-second page loads on 2G connections

# 3. Scope & Boundaries

IN SCOPE (Phase 1):

User Management:

- Role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent)
- Email/SMS verification codes
- Admin user provisioning
- School-based multi-tenancy

Core Features:

- Teacher: Course creation, validation workflow, grade management, student tracking
- Student: Course access, progress tracking, offline downloads
- Parent: Child monitoring, progress reports, teacher instructions
- Admin: School management, user administration, download permissions

Technical:

- PWA for mobile access
- Offline-first architecture with robust sync
- French/English bilingual support
- REST API backend
- Audit logging and monitoring

OUT OF SCOPE (Phase 1):

- Skill-based progression and badges (deferred to Phase 2)
- Gamification features (deferred to Phase 2)
- Native mobile applications
- Advanced analytics and AI features
- Payment systems
- Third-party integrations (LMS, video conferencing)
- Real-time collaboration features

# 4. Target Users & Personas

Primary Users:

1. Teachers - Create content, track student progress
2. Students - Learn, track skills, download courses
3. Parents - Monitor child progress
4. School Admins - Manage school operations

User Journey:

```
Student: School WiFi → Download courses → Study offline → Sync when online
Teacher: Create content → Assign to students → Track progress → Update grades
```

# 5. Technical Foundation

Architecture Decisions:

- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript
- Backend: Next.js API Routes + separate services if needed
- Database: PostgreSQL (Neon) with connection pooling
- State Management: Zustand (lightweight, simple)
- Styling: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Authentication: NextAuth.js with email verification
- Offline Storage: Browser IndexedDB (PWA)
- File Storage: AWS S3 or Vercel Blob Storage

Data Synchronization Strategy:

- Delta updates - only sync changed data
- Resumable downloads - course packages can resume if interrupted
- Conflict resolution - last write wins for simple data, manual merge for grades

# 6. Core Features Detailed

Course System:

- Interactive content with timed elements
- Video support with progress tracking
- Multiple content types (text, video, PDF, interactive)
- Course validation workflow with teacher collaboration
- Downloadable in chunks for poor connections
- Resume-able downloads for interrupted connections

Parent-Teacher Communication:

- Teacher instructions for parents (visible only to parents)
- Instruction completion tracking with checkboxes
- Progress reports and notifications
- Parent-student association with verification

Assessment & Grading:

- Progress tracking and completion status
- Grade management by teachers
- Parent progress dashboards
- Teacher analytics on class performance

Offline Capabilities:

- PWA with service workers and IndexedDB
- Delta sync (only changed data)
- Conflict resolution with role-based priority
- Background sync with exponential backoff
- Admin-controlled download permissions

# 7. Constraints & Challenges

Technical Constraints:

- Must work on low-end devices
- Support 2G/3G connections
- Offline-first design
- Data usage optimization

Regional Considerations:

- French/English/Malagasy multilingual interface
- Cultural appropriateness of content
- Data privacy for minors compliance

# 8. Phase 1 Timeline (28-30 weeks)

**Note:** Timeline extended from original 12 weeks to account for complexity of offline sync, security requirements, and real-world testing needs.

Weeks 1-6: Foundation & Security

- Infrastructure setup, authentication, 2FA, RBAC, audit logging

Weeks 7-14: Core Features

- Course system, validation workflow, parent features, notifications

Weeks 15-22: Offline & PWA

- PWA foundation, offline sync with conflict resolution, course downloads

Weeks 23-30: Testing & Launch

- Comprehensive testing, security audit, performance optimization, real-world testing in Madagascar, pilot deployment

**Buffer Time:** 20-30% buffer time included in each phase for unforeseen challenges

# 9. Success Criteria
