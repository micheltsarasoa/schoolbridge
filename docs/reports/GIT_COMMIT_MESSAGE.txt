feat: Improve database schema with type-safe enums and comprehensive documentation

CHANGES:
- Add ValidationStatus and AttendanceStatus enums to database schema
- Add LESSON and ASSIGNMENT values to ContentType enum
- Activate unused SubmissionStatus enum by adding status field to Submission model
- Replace Attendance.present boolean with AttendanceStatus enum (PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE, EXCUSED)
- Replace CourseValidation.status string field with ValidationStatus enum type
- Fix and enhance course seed data system with 3 complete courses and 13 content items
- Generate Prisma migrations (20251101021319, 20251101022636)

DOCUMENTATION:
- Create docs/database-structure.md with comprehensive Mermaid ERD diagram
- Create docs/enum-analysis.md with detailed enum analysis and migration notes
- Create docs/ENUM_FIX_SUMMARY.md with executive summary of improvements

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Enhanced type safety through database-level enum validation
- Better code documentation via strong enum types
- Support for granular attendance tracking (late arrivals, excused absences)
- Explicit submission lifecycle tracking with dedicated status field
- Improved data integrity with enum constraints instead of string validation
- Comprehensive database documentation for team onboarding

MIGRATIONS:
- 20251101021319_add_lesson_and_assignment_content_types
- 20251101022636_add_missing_enums_and_fields

SEED DATA:
- 3 complete courses: Python Programming, Digital Skills, Practical Mathematics
- 13 content items with realistic educational content
- 5 student enrollments with varied progress percentages
- 3 sample submissions demonstrating submission workflow

TESTING:
- All enum values used in seed data verified
- Schema migrations tested for correctness
- TypeScript compilation verified
- No data loss through migration process

DEPLOYMENT:
- Backward compatible: existing data preserved with sensible defaults
- No new environment variables required
- PostgreSQL native ENUM support utilized
- Rollback procedure documented

This work addresses 3 identified type-safety issues and sets foundation for future
submission workflow automation, attendance analytics, and course review improvements.

BREAKING: Frontend components must be updated to use new enum types. See
docs/ENUM_FIX_SUMMARY.md for integration checklist.
