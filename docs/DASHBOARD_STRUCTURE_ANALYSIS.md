**Dashboard Content Priorities:**

**Phase 1 (Immediate - Sprint 2-3):**
- [ ] Overview cards: Attendance %, Average Grade, Upcoming Deadlines
- [ ] Today's schedule (integrate with Planning)
- [ ] Course progress cards with percentage
- [ ] Upcoming assignments (priority sorted)

**Phase 2 (Sprint 4-5):**
- [ ] Quizzes: To Do, In Progress, Completed tabs
- [ ] Weekly timetable preview
- [ ] Next class countdown timer

**Phase 3 (Sprint 6+):**

#### 💡 Recommendations

**KEEP:**
- Hierarchical course navigation (good UX)
- Forecast feature (unique predictor)
- Combined Results & Badges (motivational)
- Simple notification preview in sidebar

**ADD (Priority Order):**

3. **Settings submenu** - User preferences, language, offline storage management
4. **Attendance tracking** - Critical for school administration

**MODIFY:**
- Make course submenu **dynamic from database** (not hardcoded Math/Science)
- Add **offline indicators** to show which content is downloaded

**DEFER:**
- Complex grade prediction algorithms (keep Forecast simple for now)

2. **Academic Progress view** - Main parent concern
3. **School Communication** - Essential for offline announcements
4. **Digital permission slips** - Reduce paper in Madagascar context

**MODIFY:**

#### 💡 Recommendations

**KEEP:**
- Current structure (well-organized)

- Relationships management (unique feature)
- Dashboard charts (already good)

**ADD (Priority Order):**
1. **Audit Log Viewer** - Model exists, just needs UI!
2. **Permission Management** - RBAC configuration
3. **System Configuration** - Global settings panel
4. **Academic Structure** - Manage classes, subjects, academic years
5. **Platform Analytics** - Usage statistics

**MODIFY:**
- Group User Management by **role tabs** (Students, Parents, Teachers, Staff)
- Add **School-wise filtering** to most admin views

**DEFER:**
- Complex form builder (use simple forms first)
- Advanced approval workflows (start with simple approve/reject)
- Integration settings (add when integrations are built)

**CRITICAL MISSING:**
- **No Admin sidebar component** - Need to create `/src/components/admin-sidebar.tsx`

---

### 5. 🎓 EDUCATIONAL MANAGER DASHBOARD (NEW ROLE)

#### ❌ Not Currently Implemented

**Assessment:** This is a **strategic role** not yet in the SchoolBridge schema.

#### 🎯 Recommendation

**DEFER to Phase 4+** (After Sprint 12)

**Rationale:**
- Not in current Prisma schema (would need new UserRole)
- Overlaps with Admin for small schools
- More relevant for multi-school deployments
- Can be built as Admin role extension initially

**If Implemented Later:**
- Create as **EDUCATIONAL_MANAGER** role
- Focus on: Curriculum oversight, Teacher performance, Strategic KPIs
- Build on top of existing Admin analytics
- Target: District-level administrators in Madagascar

## 🌍 Madagascar Context Considerations

### Offline-First Priorities
1. **Digital ID cards** - Offline proof of enrollment
2. **Downloaded course content** - Offline learning
3. **Offline attendance** - Sync when online
4. **Offline messaging queue** - Store messages for sync
5. **Minimal data payloads** - Low bandwidth consideration

### Scalability for Low-Resource Settings
1. **Simple interfaces** - Low-end device support
2. **Progressive enhancement** - Core features work offline
3. **Bulk operations** - Import/export for data management
4. **Lightweight assets** - Optimize images/media
5. **SMS fallback** - For notifications (future)

### Cultural/Educational Adaptations
1. **French language support** - Primary language (next-intl ready)
2. **Multiple children per parent** - Common in Madagascar
3. **Community school model** - Multi-grade classrooms
4. **Limited teacher resources** - Resource sharing important
5. **Paper reduction** - Digital forms critical
