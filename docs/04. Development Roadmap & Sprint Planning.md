## 4. Risk Management

### High-Priority Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Offline sync data corruption | High | Medium | Extensive testing, versioning, rollback capability |
| Poor performance on low-end devices | High | High | Early device testing, performance budgets, progressive enhancement |
| Network infrastructure in Madagascar | High | Medium | Offline-first design, resumable operations, low bandwidth optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Security audit (Sprint 12), penetration testing, regular dependency updates |
| Scope creep delaying launch | Medium | High | Strict MVP definition, feature flags, phase-based rollout |

### Regional & Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Teacher adoption resistance | High | Comprehensive training, phased rollout, champion teachers |
| Limited technical support on-site | Medium | Remote monitoring, detailed documentation, local admin training |
| Data privacy compliance | High | Legal review, GDPR/COPPA compliance from day 1 |
| Insufficient bandwidth for sync | Medium | Delta sync, compression, sync scheduling during off-peak |

### Mitigation Strategies

· **Weekly demos** with stakeholders to catch issues early
· **Feature flags** for gradual rollout and quick rollback
· **Device testing lab** established by Sprint 7
· **Real-world pilot** (Sprint 13) before full launch
· **Buffer time** (20-30%) in each phase
· **Comprehensive error logging** and alerting
· **Regular security audits** and dependency updates
